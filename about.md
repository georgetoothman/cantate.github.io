Computer languages use words that often contain objects. Think about this word as literally having a three-dimensional quality. Three-dimensional is the correct way of describing it because this word is literally referencing data in memory on a computer hard drive, which is a thing. *Which is a thing* is some slang I picked up from our teaching padrone while studying web development at [Flatiron School](https://learn.co/tracks/intro-to-ruby-development). He rocks, and after programming for a while with him you might also realize how ubiquitously using some such phrase as this can quickly lead to more proficiency. We in the biz call "more proficiency" **metaprogramming**. Which padrone is also quite good at. Nevermind how the phrase and proficiency are related. There's probably an error in that logic somewhere. 

Look here. Great, you are beginning to scan document pages in markdown like you are opening a scroll in some foreign, but important language. Sometimes a single word or phrase just jumps off the page. The key to understanding most of what is written on this blog is knowing that it started off as a requirement. Yup, I was told I had to have a blog. Turns out, *learn*ing to program is taken pretty seriously these days (for realsies - see [learn.co](https://learn.co), *and* thank me later if you found the pun). The second key to understanding this scrolling page of blog posts (say that 10 times fast!) is the title, `Web 3 Dot 0`. It partly references one of my aspirations, and partly relates to the business I founded, [Cantate Dot Co., Inc.](http://cantate.co). See my thinking was they could kind of work together - you know, the blog and the business.

The posts are my own and do not reflect the views of others, even at Cantate Dot Co. Occasionally, my writing reflects more than what I have learned but also the experiences I have had in the field with clients or at conferences.
