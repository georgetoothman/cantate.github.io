Computer languages use words that often contain objects. Think about these words as literally having three-dimensions. Three-dimensional is the correct way of describing it because these words are literally referencing data in memory on a computer hard drive, which is a thing. *Which is a thing* is some slang I picked up from our teaching padrone while studying web development at [Flatiron School](https://learn.co/tracks/intro-to-ruby-development). 

He rocks, and after programming with him for a while you might also realize how using some such phrase as *"which is a thing"* can quickly lead to more proficiency. We in the biz call "more proficiency" **metaprogramming**. Which padrone is also quite good at. Nevermind exactly how the phrase and proficiency are directly or even indirectly related. There's probably an error in the model somewhere...or maybe its in the view. Nevermind for now.

The key to understanding most of what is written on this blog is knowing that it started off as a requirement. Yup, I was told I had to have a blog. Turns out, *learn*ing to program is taken pretty seriously these days (for realsies - see [www.learn.co](https://learn.co)). The second key to understanding this scrolling page is the title: `Web 3 Dot 0`. It partly references one of my aspirations, and partly relates to the business I founded, [Cantate Dot Co., Inc](http://cantate.co).

The posts are my own and do not reflect the views of others, even at Cantate Dot Co. Occasionally, my writing reflects more than what I have learned but also the experiences I have had in the field with clients or at conferences.
