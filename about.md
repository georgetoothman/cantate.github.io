**Early Life and Family**
I grew up in a small town south of Pittsburgh, PA. 

**Going Away for School**  
It is hard to describe the feeling of leaving home when I did. At first, it was frightening to live in the heart of mid-town Manhattan as a boarding school student, but I later came to appreciate just how unique it was to be there.  

**Business Experience**  
After completing my undergraduate degree at Harvard, I took a role with a start-up called [Identified, Inc](http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2014/02/27/workday-acquires-identified-a-potential-disruptive-move-in-recruiting/#37a03f9c585b) which had about a dozen or so employees at that time. I worked alongside the Biz Dev/Sales Team. I first gained exposure to professional programming when the company merged offices in San Francisco. I was fascinated by the product the engineers were building and decided to learn some of what they were doing in the evening hours after work.  

Following a briefly fore into politics in 2012, I returned to work in mid-town Manhattan at the boarding school I used to attend. During this time I started to see the value of my education there in context of the world around it. Students were better at typing and with computers than I had been, and the role of technology was flourishing.  

**Passions and Interests**  
I was offered an opportunity to learn more about computer programming, and after three years in finance and IT, I resigned to enroll full-time at Flatiron School for their Web Development cohort. Shortly thereafter, I commenced work at [Cantate Dot Co.](https://www.cantate.co), which I founded in late November of 2015.  

I am inspired by music and athletes and have been involved with both on an amateur level throughout my life. Iâ€™ve competed internationally as an oarsman and triathlete and continue to sing on pitch *pretty frequently*.  

**Contact Me**  
I am living in Connecticut, a wonderful state, which was once home to a great amount of industry.
