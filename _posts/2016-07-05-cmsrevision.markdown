At work this week, I am facing a challenging confluence of priorities. I am contracted to perfom a job which I know I can do, but there are other areas of work besides this, and it stands outside my current contractual agreement. The only way I noticed that other areas have needed attention was by withdrawing from that comfortable place where I had been effectively working. 

The challenge for me is that to suggest another contract would seem to reduce the commitment I have to performing my current job. *This area needs some some attention, oh but I am also needed for that thing* -- and it seems disingenuous. If I build out a new contract and statement of work, it has got to have some legs to stand on. 

Here are my thoughts on creating the new contract and statement of work. Helping a business with two difinitive contratual obligations is neither prioritizing the client, nor the vendor. What actually helps, is a alignment of values. I mean that there has got to be a fundamental, mathematical truth that girds the success of these two entities. 

I want to establish at the outset an axiom by which I am commiting the organization which I founded. Business grinds on each day, the economy changes and everyone has their own view on whether or not something will succeed. Fundamentally, I am asking whether or not a business can fail when it derives its worth from a mathematical principle? 

An organization cannot have a substantial business model without having a target market. Thus, I am introducing the target market of Content Management Systems to Cantate Dot Co. Two entities that should now be irrevokably linked - Content Management Systems & Cantate Dot Co., Inc. 

If you are a content managment service provider, hire your engineers to rebuild each of your client's portfolios. If you are the client which has a portfolio, hire Cantate Dot Co., Inc. to rebuild your content without a management system. I am building a company based on a mathematical axiom, and designing each client page to scale without patching it together within a standard formatted system like Russian Dolls. 

When you build a unit that has as its only purpose, the ability to collect within itself other built units, you have a Russian Doll. When you have a unit which as its only purpose is a reflection of the , you have a Chicago Bean. Let's rebuild the Russian Doll you've been using for the past 20 years to reflect something more modern.
