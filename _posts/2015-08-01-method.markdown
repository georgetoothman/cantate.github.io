<pre><code>
  def square_array(array)
      new_array = []  
        array.each do |num|
            square = num * num
            new_array << square
        end
      new_array
  end
</code></pre>

This is a method which returns the square for any set of numbers passed in as an array. By calling square_array(array) ruby is iterating over each number (as num), multiplying the number by itself and setting it to a new variable called square. Square is then passed into the new_array which was instantiated outside of the each iterator. We know that this will hold the new square integer because of `variable scope`. From within the array.each method Ruby has access to new_array. new_array is holding each integer until the each method finishes. Following the completion of the each method, new_array will return the new_array which now holds all square integers from the method.
