Lately, I've been considering how to create the fabic which underlies the corporate structure that is established at [Cantate Dot Co., Inc.](http://cantate.co). There are a couple different reasons for starting this business; I've laid out some below.

Creating a corporate entity is a bit like shopping for shoes or insurance plans. Once the corporate structure is established, it can really begin working for you. It is the engine. The fabic that underlies this structure is where the rubber meets the road. To reuse a major point in "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" - what is the quality -- in this example, what is the quality of that fabric? How is the business structure engaging with its business? What is propelling it to new clients?

1.	There are businesses without a web presence *all over*.
These essential community shops and service providers that fuel you on the day-to-day. Taking a neighborhod store from zero web presence to becoming an online business can be a journey spanning half a year or more.

1.	Even businesses with a web presence, don't have IT wherewhithall.
They may think about the IT needs of their storefront when there's an outage or a fault, but not more than once or twice a year are they revitalizing their tech or leveraging it to useful areas where business has been stiffled or bottlenecked. Are there ways your business could apply an algorithm, create a new online form or add speed to the load time on its webpage? 

1.	The business that you own or operate is already global. 
You own and operate a hair salon with two stylists and two chairs. There's a third station that's a wash basin. Your hair products are imported from manufacturers that sell at major US distributors. Their employees are from another country. IT, practically applied, is how you bring the global stage to selling and how you inform your selling...better hair styles, a greater audience, maximizing customers, managing inventory, etc., etc.

So where do you start? I recomend to local businesses to start social. Start building your brand on [Twitter](https://twitter.com) and [Facebook](https://facebook.com) and [Foursquare][Foursquare]. Use social media to illustrate the experience of shopping with you. Lastly, articulate that shopping with you online is local - even if the coffee they're buying came from far away. Eventually, Facebook [Shop][Shop] will be a way to bring business under this umbrella.
