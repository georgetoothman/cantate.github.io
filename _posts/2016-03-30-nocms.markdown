title: A Content Management System (CMS) Scares Me Too
category: posts
---  

Did you ever have the experience of eagerly purchasing a fresh new domain name for the purpose of launching your own enterprise? You may have found it particularly cumbersome.  

Once the excitement of your new idea dies down and the Domain Name Service providers like [GoDaddy][GoDaddy]
or [Yourmembership][Yourmembership] have confused you with their ever growing number of package deals and service tier levels, you may not be readily muttering the words “scale” or “pivot.”

These packaged web servers are what the industry refers to as [Content Management Systems][Content Management Systems] and they can be useful in the same way an all-in-one car wash puts your vehicle on the conveyer belt, scrubs it, and automatically dries it with air jets. In my own opinion, they’re missing a bunch of nooks and gloss over the parts that can really shine.  

Now that programming languages are more abstracted — ++ Matz — the modern web developer can rewrite every CMS in a fraction of the time it takes to manage a long standing CMS account or constantly iterate within the confines of the so-called platform de jure. 

I needed to close this post out with something pithy, so thanks for the entry, Joel S. “Whats the best thing about Switzerland? ...The flag is big plus.”
