This post is directly related to an assignment on [`Learn Verified`][`Learn Verified`].

# Step 1
Create an empty hash where the names of your darling pigeons will go.
Since pigeons are so darling there can only be one of a kind, so get all of their names...
by using iteration and two enumerable methods.
Make a hash with the name as a key and an empty hash as the value.

# Step 2
Iterate over the data argument once again now going full charge at getting the empty...
hash with the names (you got this in step 1) their respective color, gender, lives keys.
Remember you have a color hash to deal with which has the names of the darling pigeons in array as values.

# Step 3
Pigeons in the coop or money in the bank. Now you have to set up an empty array at the level where you're going to shovel 
the color/gender/lives hash keys in as strings.
Step 3.5 
Iterate over that color hash to get to the purple, grey, central park keys level (I call this qualities)...
where the value will be that tricky array of names.

# Step 4
Remember you've got that name value from step one which you can compare against the pesky names array.
If the pesky names array includes a match on that name, shovel it into the correct level of your hash.

# Result
<pre><code>
  def nyc_pigeon_organizer(data)
    hash_of_pigeons = {}
    data[:gender].values.flatten.each do |name|
      hash_of_pigeons[name] = {}                #makes a hash with the name as a key and hash as the value
      data.each do |attribute, color_hash|
        hash_of_pigeons[name][attribute] = []
        color_hash.each do |qualities, more_names|
          hash_of_pigeons[name][attribute] << qualities.to_s if more_names.include?(name)
        end
      end
    end
    hash_of_pigeons
  end
</code></pre>
