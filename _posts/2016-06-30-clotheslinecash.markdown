One of my favorite references for the direction of the world wide web is David Heinemeier-Hansson, the creator of Rails. His fascinating company [37signals](http://37signals.com/manifesto) has produced such products as *Highrise*, *Campfire*, and is now known as the highly sought after development shop, **Basecamp**. Sometimes, starting in business is a rough go. But finding clients is never the easiest aspect of the actual work. Occasionally, businesses can thrive on a cash only model, which, as he has written, 37signals does (link [here](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3972-reconsider).
 
I began to take interest in the elite jobs of venture funding while working with Identified, Inc. Our business office was located in the SOMA District of California's San Francisco. Investors frequently visited, often arriving unbenounced to the team and then staying on for a game of fooseball or the weekly stand-up meeting. We had fun chatting and hearing about their start-up success stories.
 
Since then, my own feelings on the subject of VC funding have changed. What amount of equity are the lowest investors earning? How far removed is the founders' vision from that of the investors'? Is VC a rigmarole?
 
The next big tech boom isn't going to appear from anywhere outside of the current VC ecosystem. Like most things, the decision to invest is less a matter of finding the so-called "black swan event" (see Nassim Teleb's book of the same name, or read http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/books/chapters/0422-1st-tale.html), than it is about stitching together the next line of cloth.
